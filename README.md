# Overview
To construct a classifier to predict the drug response of patients. We used proteome data of response patients as baseline. We build a reference interval (RI) with the distribution of response protein abundance, which could be used for anomaly detection if the protein abundance exceeds the upper limit of the RI. For any query sample, an outlier is defined as a protein whose expression level is higher than the upper limit of the RI, and the detection of multiple outliers would further increase the statistical confidence for patients with non-response. To this end, we constructed proteomic RIs derived from 29 response samples. The upper limit of the RI is defined as P75 + 3*(P75 â€“ P25), where P75 and P25 are the 75th percentile and 25th percentile of the protein abundance in the response groups, respectively. We trained a linear classifier to classify the patient with different drug response using significance of drug response outliers.
